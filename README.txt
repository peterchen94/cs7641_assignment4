Step 1: Download code and output folders from from github: https://github.gatech.edu/cchen376/cchen376_assignment4 

Step 1: Install latest version of Jython 2.7 http://www.jython.org/ 

Step 2: Ensure that burlap.jar file is referenced correctly in the python scripts (near top)

Step 3: Run scripts from the command line using <jython script.py> command. Scripts will dump output files in the folder names are seen below: 

Scripts (for running RL experiments)
	1. easyGW_cchen376.py
	2. hardGW_cchen376.py

Folders 
	1.  easyGW_output
	2.	hardGW_output


Step 4: Utilize the analysis ipython notebook files or python scripts to generate analysis plots for report. Ensure that the notebooks are reading from the right output paths (see above) 


Analysis Notebooks and Py files are located in the output folders 

	1. easyGW_analysis.ipynb
	2. hardGW_analysis.ipynb

Python scripts of these analysis notebooks are also available 


	1. easyGW_analysis.py
	2. hardGW_analysis.py
